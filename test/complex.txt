LAS VEGAS, Nevada â€” Thousands of people poured into a football stadium in Las Vegas on Sunday. They came to mark the anniversary of massive women's marches held in 2017. The 2017 marches took place across the world and were organized to protest the election of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The event in Las Vegas capped off a weekend of global demonstrations. Participants hoped the protests will increase demands for justice and an end to sexual harassment.
